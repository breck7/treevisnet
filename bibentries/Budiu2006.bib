  abstract = {We present an experiment that compares how people perform search tasks in a degree-of-interest browser and in a Windows-Explorer-like browser. Our results show that, whereas users do attend to more information in the DOI browser, they do not complete the task faster than in an Explorer-like browser. However, in both types of browser, users are faster to complete high information scent search tasks than low information scent tasks. We present an ACT-R computational model of the search task in the DOI browser. The model describes how a visual search strategy may combine with semantic aspects of processing, as captured by information scent. We also describe a way of automatically estimating information scent in an ontological hierarchy by querying a large corpus (in our case, Google's corpus).},
