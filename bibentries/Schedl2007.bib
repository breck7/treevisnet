  abstract = {We present a novel visualization approach that extends the Sunburst technique to the third dimension, which allows for encoding additional data in the height of each arc segment. By stacking a number of such 3D-Sunbursts, we build a user interface for browsing collections of web pages. We apply techniques for web content indexing of multimedia data (text, audio, image, video) and text analysis to create a UI where each layer of the Sunburst stack represents a specific multimedia content type. We call this user interface the Co-Occurrence Browser (COB) and demonstrate its usability on a collection of web pages related to music artists.},
