  title = {{Timeline Trees}: visualizing sequences of transactions in information hierarchies},
  pages = {75--82},
  abstract = {In many applications transactions between the elements of an information hierarchy occur over time. For example, the product offers of a department store can be organized into product groups and subgroups to form an information hierarchy. A market basket consisting of the products bought by a customer forms a transaction. Market baskets of one or more customers can be ordered by time into a sequence of transactions. Each item in a transaction is associated with a measure, for example, the amount paid for a product. In this paper we present a novel method for visualizing sequences of these kinds of transactions in information hierarchies. It uses a tree layout to draw the hierarchy and a timeline to represent progression of transactions in the hierarchy. We have developed several interaction techniques that allow the users to explore the data. Smooth animations help them to track the transitions between views. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by examples from several very different application domains.},
