  abstract = {Genealogical information systems (GIS) typically contain large amounts of information about families and relationships between family members. Most existing GIS have textual, form-based interfaces for searching and browsing family information. These interfaces do not support dynamic browsing and manipulation of family trees. This paper discusses the design and development of a novel interface, called ZoomTree, for WINGIS (the GIS developed at UPE), to facilitate dynamic exploration and browsing of family tree information.},
