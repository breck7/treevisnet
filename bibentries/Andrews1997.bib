  abstract = {This paper presents work in progress on a new technique for visualising and manipulating large hierarchies. The Information Pyramids approach compactly visualises hierarchical structures in three dimensions using pyramid-like structures, which grow upwards as the hierarchy is descended. The technique is described in the context of our early experience with a prototype file system visualiser based on Information Pyramids.},
