  abstract = {An extension to the treemap method for the visualization of hierarchical information, such as directory structures and organization structures, is presented. The standard treemap method often gives thin, elongated rectangles. As a result, rectangles are difficult to compare and to select. A new method is presented to generate lay-outs in which the rectangles approximate squares. To strenghten the visualization of the structure, shaded frames are used around groups of related nodes.},
