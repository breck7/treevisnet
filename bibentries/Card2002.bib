  abstract = {This paper proposes Degree-of-Interest trees. These trees use degree-of-interest calculations and focus+context visualization methods, together with bounding constraints, to fit within pre-established bounds. The method is an instance of an emerging "attention-reactive" user interface whose components are designed to snap together in bounded spaces.},
