  abstract = {This paper describes how information visualization techniques can be used to monitor a web-based collaborative platform and to support workplace awareness by providing a global overview of the activities. An innovative prototype is described. Its originality relies on using some enclosure-based visualization methods in the context of activities monitoring, which is rather unusual. In addition, a new layout is described for representing data trees. The use of the system is illustrated with the case of a EU-funded Network of Excellence.},
