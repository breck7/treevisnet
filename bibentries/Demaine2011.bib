  abstract = {We show how to realize a stacked 3D polytope (formed by repeatedly stacking a tetrahedron onto a triangular face) by a strictly convex embedding with its n vertices on an integer grid of size $O(n^4)\times O(n^4)\times O(n^{18})$. We use a perturbation technique to construct an integral 2D embedding that lifts to a small 3D polytope, all in linear time. This result solves a question posed by G\"unter M. Ziegler, and is the first nontrivial subexponential upper bound on the long-standing open question of the grid size necessary to embed arbitrary convex polyhedra, that is, about efficient versions of Steinitz's 1916 theorem. An immediate consequence of our result is that $O(\log n)$-bit coordinates suffice for a greedy routing strategy in planar 3-trees.},
