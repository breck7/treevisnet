  abstract = {We consider one-to-one, congestion one layouts of complete binary trees into 2-D grids and extended 2-D grids. For such a layout of the complete binary tree $T_h$ of height h into the square $n\times n$ grid we consider the layout's expansion ratio r=n*n/(2^(h+1) -1). For r the least expansion among layouts of $T_h$ into grids, we obtain the bounds 1.122<=r<=1.4656 for large h and n. For layouts into extended grids we similarly obtain bounds 1.03<=r<=1.115. The upper bounds are improvements on previous work, while the lower bounds are the first such to appear.},
